<h3>Riley / a student experiencing homelessness</h3>

<p>Each year, an estimated 4.2 million youth and young adults experience homelessness, and Riley is a fictional example of one of these young adults. Riley is queer and non-gender binary, with the preferred pronouns they/them. They are now 18 years old and have been estranged from their biological family since they were 15 due to their family’s inability to accept their gender and sexuality. Riley left their home in Ohio and hitchhiked to California where they are now enrolled in community college while struggling to find a stable apartment. LGBTQ+ students experience high rates of housing insecurity, twice as high as their cisgender or heterosexual peers, largely due to family rejection (<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-10-21/homeless-students-in-california-ucla-report" target="_blank">Newberry 2020</a>), and Riley is now juggling school and a part-time job to try to make ends meet. They usually spend the night sleeping in their car in a Walmart parking lot. </p>

<p>The library is a refuge for Riley. They can use the toilets there and wash their face and brush their teeth in the mornings. They don’t have their own computer, so they rely on the computer lab and internet at the library to do their homework. Riley is usually exhausted and sometimes falls asleep at the keyboard, so when a rest/room arrived at their local library, it was a game changer. Riley is now able to take a safe nap before class or work.</p>

<p>They have difficulty sleeping without sound, so they take advantage of the nap meditations available in the space which also help their mental health and ability to concentrate throughout the rest of the day. They often check out a blanket to better relax on the daybeds in the space. It is difficult to sleep comfortably in their car, so the daybeds provide one of the few opportunities Riley has to rest deeply at any time day or night. Because the rest/room is in the library, a place that Riley already trusts, they feel safe, comfortable and protected while in the vulnerable sleeping position. Riley visits the rest/room almost every day and is working diligently to graduate next year and secure stable housing with the higher paycheck that a college education affords. </p>

<h3>Sam / an adult suffering from chronic insomnia</h3>

<p>Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint across all stages of adulthood (<a href="https://consensus.nih.gov/2005/insomniastatement.pdf" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health 2005</a>), and Sam is a fictional example of an adult suffering from chronic insomnia that impacts his ability to function in the daytime. The impact of sleep deprivation expands beyond just the person suffering from chronic insomnia; caregivers, partners and employers are particularly affected (<a href="https://consensus.nih.gov/2005/insomniastatement.pdf" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health 2005</a>), and Sam is struggling in both his relationship with his partner as well as with maintaining employment. He is in his mid-40s and works at an Amazon warehouse. The job is mainly physical labor, which is especially difficult after a week of being unable to sleep. Sam has received two warnings about his performance and is terrified about losing his job, especially during the holiday season.</p>

<p>Because Sam’s insomnia results in daytime drowsiness, he was relieved to discover that a rest/room mobile sleeping unit was recently installed at the public park close to his work. The rest/room space is open during the day and Sam now uses his lunch break to take a nap. He has an hour to spare so he eats quickly and then uses the rest of the time to rest. The pop-up rest/room space has five sleeping pods with a daybed in each pod, and Sam can reserve one of these pods on the rest/room website ahead of time to make sure he can use the space during his break.</p>

<p>Sam doesn’t always fall asleep, but he loves to check out the eye mask and ear plugs to rejuvenate in a state of dark silence. While Sam has a smartphone, he prefers to put it on airplane mode when he enters the space, only setting a vibrating alarm for when he must return to work. Sam is trying to address his chronic insomnia with a healthier diet and regular exercise, but it has been a difficult and bumpy process. As he progresses on his health journey, Sam is grateful for the rejuvenating rest he can access in his local rest/room as it has helped in his mental and physical health as well as in his job performance. </p>
