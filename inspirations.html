<h3><a href="https://thenapministry.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Nap Ministry</a></h3> 

<p>The Nap Ministry was founded in 2016 by Tricia Hersey as an organization dedicated to napping as a force of liberation. The Nap Ministry facilitates collective napping experiences with the framework of “Rest is Resistance”, transforming parks, yoga studios, art galleries, living rooms, churchs, and gymnasiums into spaces to rest together. Their naps incorporate tools such as soundtracks, rest alters, mediations, and post-nap talks. The Nap Ministry believes that sleep deprivation is a racial and social justice issue and thus rest can be a radical tool for community healing. In addition to IRL events, the organization has built a movement on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thenapministry/" target="_blank">social media</a>. Its framework for transforming a space and creating a process for collective napping experiences could be adapted for use in rest/room spaces, hence it is both an inspiration and potential partner.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.carolynlazard.com/a-conspiracy" target="_blank">A Conspiracy / Carolyn Lazard</a></h3>

<p>For "A Conspiracy", artist Carolyn Lazard who lives with disabling chronic illness placed sound machines on a museum’s elevator ceiling, in effect providing pockets of air to hold secret conversations while also commenting on therapeutic care when mixed with capital as these machines are most often used in a hospital setting to help patients sleep. In an interview for BOMB Magazine that references this piece, Lazard says that, “accessibility is often thought of in relation to the idea of clarity or transparency or coherence, but I think disabled people also deserve access to the incoherency of the experience of art. There are also so many incredible disabled artists who are thinking through definitions of accessibility that don’t necessarily evolve from Western frameworks of rationality or intelligibility but are focused rather on the idea of being together, of collectivity and care, grappling with the real challenges of accessibility rather than this sanitized idea of transparency. Disabled people and cross-disability collectivity are complex, and I think we deserve our complexity” (<a href="https://bombmagazine.org/articles/carolyn-lazard/" target="_blank">Damman 2020</a>). These words inspire me to think of accessibility beyond clarity for rest/room spaces, as an accessible space can also be one that celebrates incoherence. Sleeping and dreaming are themselves woven with incoherent mystery so this is fitting.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.deeplistening.rpi.edu/" target="_blank">The Center for Deep Listening</a></h3>

<p>The Center for Deep Listening was founded in 2014 to steward the Deep Listening practice created by radical composer and artist Pauline Oliveras. Oliveras described Deep Listening as a “lifelong practice” and “a way of listening in every possible way to everything possible, to hear no matter what you are doing.” Deep Listening as a practice is rooted in Oliveras’ Sonic Meditations, which are an attempt to return the control of sound to the individual and to employ sound for humanitarian purposes, specifically healing. Sonic Meditations are a group activity where no special skills are necessary, where together individuals make, imagine, listen to, and remember sounds. A favorite meditation of mine is, “Take a walk at night. Walk so silently that the bottoms of your feet become ears.” This notion of active and deep listening can alter one's consciousness, enabling a greater sensitivity and awareness to all beings. In a society where deep healing is essential, Paul Oliveras, her Sonic Meditations, and this Institute are an invaluable inspiration. To slow down and listen, together, are thus core to rest/room spaces and I can envision Sonic Meditations taking place within them.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/163616" target="_blank">4’33” / John Cage</a></h3> 

<p>John Cage’s 4’33” is a silent musical composition first performed by pianist David Tutor at Woodstock in 1952. The score is divided into three silent movements that total 4 minutes and 33 seconds in length. Cage recounted of that first performance, “You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third people themselves made all kinds of interesting sounds as they talked or walked out.” The point being that silence is never really silent; it is rather a construct that gives other sounds meaning. Cage said that, “What the piece is trying to say is that everything we do is music, or can become music.” Dreams are inseparable from music as is attested in the etymological roots of the word "dream". The music of silence in the midst of information inundation is a necessary tenet of rest/room spaces. By resting and listening to silence, a depth of reflection can emerge. </p>

<h3><a href="https://benesse-artsite.jp/en/art/arthouse.html" target="_blank">Minamidera / Tadao Ando & James Turrell</a></h3>

<p>Minamidera (literally “southern temple”) is a building designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando to accommodate the artwork "Backside of the Moon" by James Turrell on the island of Naoshima. To enter, you must turn off your phone completely. It is so dark that you cannot see your own hand in front of your face and you must feel the walls to arrive at a bench at the edge of the room. As your eyes adjust to the pitch black darkness, you begin to see light, the light of the Turrell piece. In person, it is nothing short of magical. Words cannot do it justice as it leads to a sort of rebirth of consciousness. It brought me to tears. The chaos of darkness can lead to clarity. I envision rest/room spaces having moments of complete darkness that I hope inspire a level of catharsis.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.metronaps.com/" target="_blank">MetroNaps</a></h3>

<p>MetroNaps created the world's first chair designed for napping in the work place, combining comfort, technology and design into a unique offering for in-office rest. While I appreciate how their sleep pod (called an "EnergyPod") incorporates sleep music, gentle lights/vibrations and usage tracking/management technology, I find the aesthetic design to be off-putting. The pod does not enable you to fully lay down or lay on your side, which is how I generally prefer to rest. Also, the fact that it is called an "EnergyPod" goes against the core value of a rest/room space which is that the space is about rest rather than improving productivity in the office, though it can hopefully accomplish both functions. While I like the concept of a pod for napping, I feel the design would have to be adapted to work within the rest/room aesthetic and values.</p>

<h3><a href="https://lavamaex.org/" target="_blank">Lava Mae</a></h3>

<p>Lava Mae is a non-profit organization based in San Francisco that brings critical services to the streets for people experiencing homelessness. Lava Mae was founded by Donience Sandoval in 2014 when she repurposed decommissioned city buses into mobile hygiene units with showers and toilets. Nearly every day of the week, a mobile hygiene unit parks in a  neighborhood in San Francisco and provides an extraordinary level of service to the most overlooked and stigmatized members of our society. The organization has since expanded around the globe with a replication model and a philosophy of Radical Hospitality. I had the pleasure of being an Artist-in-Residence at Lava Mae in 2019 and I saw first hand what radical empathy looks like in action. Lava Mae’s pop-up model and core principle of Radical Hospitality is a key inspiration for rest/room spaces. I could see this pop-up model applied to rest/room spaces situated in parks or other public places.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.overyondr.com/howitworks" target="_blank">Yondr</a></h3>

<p>Yondr created a patented system for phone-free spaces. The system revolves around a phone pouch that locks and can only be opened by touching an unlocking base as you exit the phone-free space. While I appreciate the core of the idea and I see its value, I feel like it is more of a hack than a way to evolve one’s relationship with technology. Maturity is the ability to make the decision to be glued to your phone but deciding to not do it, rather than being forced into this mindset. Still, I do envision rest/room spaces as ones that are primarly phone-free and how to do so is something to explore, and I do think that Yondr is better than blanket signal blocking.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm</a></h3>

<p>Calm is the #1 app for Sleep, Meditation and Relaxation, with over 50 million downloads and over 700,000 5-star reviews. The app features nap meditations which could potentially be integrated into rest/room spaces or accessible to people who do not have a space in their area. Calm currently costs $69.99 a year after a free 7 day trial but I would like to have them sponsor free accounts for rest/room dreamers.</p>
