<h2>This is the dream I dream for the future.</h2> 
<br>
<p>My dream is an information space that is devoid of information — a rest/room.</p> 

<p>A designated space to avoid information is essential as we are living in an age of information inundation. Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, said in 2010, that the amount of information created between the dawn of civilization and 2003 is now being created every two days. I can only imagine that this rate of creation has but increased in the decade since his statement.</p> 

<p>Information overload is the inevitable result, a situation where an excessive amount of information becomes a hindrance rather than an assistance. This issue has been discussed since the 1990s, with studies showing that waste of time, decrease in efficiency, and ill-health are all allegedly caused by information overload (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Introduction_to_Information_Science/y0SAZwEACAAJ?hl=en" target="_blank">Bawden and Robinson 2012</a>).</p> 

<p>We are also struggling with a lack of sleep on a systematic level, with 30 percent of the general population experiencing sleep disruption and at least 10 percent suffering from chronic insomnia that impairs their ability to function in the daytime (<a href="https://consensus.nih.gov/2005/insomniastatement.pdf" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health 2005</a>). There have also been links between lack of sleep and the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. When our brains do not have enough time to rest, toxins build up in the cerebrospinal fluid which leads to disease (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-we-sleep" target="_blank">Konnikova 2015</a>). Simply put, we are sleeping less in both quantity and quality of rest, all with dismal effects.</p> 

<p>There is absolutely a link between sleep deprivation and information inundation as digital screens function as a drug for wakefulness, emitting blue light which can suppress the body’s secretion of melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/at-home/insomnia-advice.html" target="_blank">Zuckerman 2020</a>). The impacts of both also reveal overlapping consequences from increased stress to the inability to concentrate to poor health.</p> 
<br>

<h3>a rest/room space</h3>

<p>A rest/room addresses these issues as it is designed for information avoidance in the form of rest.</p> 

<p>My initial vision for this space is a room within a library. I envision it devoid of information, as much as that is possible. A visual palette of calming colors, clean lines and aesthetically thoughtful daybeds with built-in pillows, all made of materials that can be easily cleaned  between dreamers. I would imagine, instead of borrowing books, you could check out an eye mask, ear plugs or a blanket.</p> 

<p>In my utopian future, there would be rest/rooms in all public spaces, like how bathrooms exist in museums, schools, parks, etc. But instead of having one bathroom for women and another for men,  we could consolidate two gendered bathrooms into one bathroom that can be used by all people and then transform the extra bathroom into a rest/room, hence the name.</p>
<br>

<h3>key inspirations/partners</h3>

<p>Much of the inspiration for rest/room spaces comes from artworks that explore the essential natures of silence and darkness.</p>

<p>I was particularly moved by <a href="https://benesse-artsite.jp/en/art/arthouse.html" target="_blank">Minamidera</a>, a building designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando to accommodate the artwork "Backside of the Moon" by James Turrell on the island of Naoshima. It is a sanctuary of and for darkness, without discounting that light itself is needed to define its opposite. And, any discussion of silence as a productive force would be incomplete without mentioning <a href="https://www.moma.org/collection/works/163616" target="_blank">4’33”</a> by John Cage. A score composed of three silent movements, 4’33” speaks to the point that silence is never really silent and that everything we do is or can be music. By resting and listening to silence, a depth of reflection can emerge.</p>

<p>As accessibility to rest is a core tenet of rest/room spaces, my thinking on accessibility has found inspiration in the work of artist Carolyn Lazard who lives with disabling chronic illness and speaks of accessibility beyond clarity rooted in collectivity and care. Sleeping and dreaming are woven with incoherent mystery and all bodies deserve access to this experience of being.</p>
  
<p>The amount of social movements related to rest and sleep also only seem to be increasing. It's inevitable that an inundation of technology will lead to its opposite. My thinking on rest as an essential social right is woven from the work of activists like Tricia Hersey who founded <a href="https://thenapministry.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Nap Ministry</a>, an organization dedicated to napping as a force of liberation with a conviction that sleep deprivation is a racial and social justice issue. I see The Nap Ministry both as an inspiration and potential partner for rest/room spaces.</p>
  
<p>As this endeavor is one rooted in the avoidance of information, the technology used within the space must enable that impulse rather than dim it. <a href="https://www.overyondr.com/howitworks" target="_blank">Yondr</a> is an interesting hardware example that comes to mind in this context. The company created a patented system for phone-free spaces. I do envision rest/rooms as phone-free and while I'm not sold on Yondr in this context, I do think it's a better solution than signal blocking. There are also numerous meditation apps and I could see rest/room spaces in partnership with apps like <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm</a> to lead guided nap meditations for dreamers who need sound to sleep or those who do not have access to a rest/room space in person.</p>

<p>Because I see a future where rest/rooms are in all public spaces, the two key technical inspirations for a pop-up or pod-based napping solution are <a href="https://lavamaex.org/" target="_blank">Lava Mae</a> and <a href="http://www.metronaps.com/" target="_blank">MetroNaps</a>. Lava Mae created mobile hygiene units to bring showers and toilets to the streets for people experiencing homelessness, and MetroNaps created nap pods, called "EnergyPods", for companies to provide as an amenity for their office workers. Both organizations and their mobile services provide valuable structural and technological inspiration for rest/room spaces.</p>
<br>

<h3>dreamer demographics</h3>

<p>While I would suggest that all bodies are my demographic given our anxiety-filled reality, I am specifically interested in serving students experiencing homelessness as well as adults suffering from chronic insomnia.</p> 

<p>Each year, an estimated 4.2 million youth and young adults experience homelessness, of which 700,000 are unaccompanied minors according to the <a href="https://www.chapinhall.org/project/voices-of-youth-count/" target="_blank">Voices of Youth Count</a>, a national initiative to bring actionable evidence to end youth homelessness. These numbers are only expected to surge due to COVID-related job losses and economic instability.</p> 

<p>And as I mentioned earlier, approximately ten percent of the population suffers from chronic insomnia, a condition linked to low quality of life, depression, poor memory and concentration, increases in cardiovascular disease and hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, cognitive and motor impairment, and a number of other medical conditions (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/why-we-sleep" target="_blank">Konnikova 2015</a>). And, the impact of sleep deprivation expands beyond just the person suffering from chronic insomnia. Caregivers, partners and employers are particularly affected (<a href="https://consensus.nih.gov/2005/insomniastatement.pdf" target="_blank">National Institutes of Health 2005</a>).</p> 

<p>Both of these demographics as well as their support networks are in dire need of a safe space to rest during the day. I can think of no safe place to sleep in public; the streets are inhospitable, there are barely benches inside museums, public bathrooms are currently far from comfortable to rest in. This reality must be reexamined.</p>

<p>Because simply put: <em>if we can’t sleep in public, how can we dream as a public?</em></p>
